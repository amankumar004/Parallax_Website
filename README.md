# Parallax_Website

###Description

I made this parallax website using HTML and CSS. First part of it shows a Adventure Image in which we see that mountains are far behind the person standing there and looks like he is looking at the mountains this effect is made by using flex properties in CSS in which I hidden the overflow in x-direction and auto in y-direction. I also include properties of z-index and transfrom to create a 3d effect of the image. 

Next part of page shows a article section in which there is some written text with attach background image with a heading in center these effect are shown with many properties such as position, z-index, padding, border, font, transform etc.
